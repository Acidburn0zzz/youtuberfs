youtuberfs is a real implementation of YouTube filesystem made in Java using JNI.
Source code will be uploaded before the end of February 2010.
It is now in very early stage- basicly usable but with many problems, which i'll solve ASAP (i hope). This project is based on fuse4j and most likely it is just an extension.
